# Parameter Estimation

**Parameter estimation** is a fundamental concept in statistics used to infer unknown parameters of a probability distribution based on observed data. It involves finding the best estimate, often called the point estimate, for the unknown parameters.

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

In the context of **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**, which is a common method for parameter estimation, the goal is to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function. The likelihood function represents the probability of observing the given data, given specific parameter values.

### Example 1: Normal Distribution

For example, in the first scenario described, we have a random sample from a Normal distribution with unknown mean (θ1) and variance (θ2). The MLE of θ1 and θ2 would be the values that maximize the likelihood of observing the given sample under the assumed Normal distribution.

### Example 2: Binomial Distribution

Similarly, in the second scenario, we have a random sample from a Binomial distribution with unknown parameter θ. The MLE of θ would be the value that maximizes the likelihood of observing the given sample under the assumed Binomial distribution.

## Importance in Various Fields

Parameter estimation is crucial in various fields such as finance, engineering, biology, and social sciences, where understanding the underlying distributions and their parameters is essential for making informed decisions and drawing valid conclusions from data. MLE is one of the commonly used techniques for parameter estimation due to its simplicity and desirable properties, such as consistency and efficiency.
